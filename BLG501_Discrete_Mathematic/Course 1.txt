Sets:
    U Universal Sets
    E: Any kind of set part of U (part of = C below bare)

Steps:
    1: Basis:           B set . as x part of B, x part of E
    2: Set of rules:    for any x part of E, we can create a new x using a rule which is part of E
    3: Closure:         any element of E should be in E after using any rule

Induction:
    B0 = B
    B1 = B0 union rule(B0)
    Bi+1 = Bi union rule(Bi)

height:
    h(x) = min(i|x part of Bi)

Ex: Even number:
    B = {0}
    rule = n part of E => (n+2) part of E

Ex: Well-formed formula
    A: set of atomic proposition
    S: set of operator (&, |, ~, ->, <->, ...)
    U = (A union S)*

    B = A
    rules = [f1(x)=~x, f2(x,y)=(x&y), ...]



Peano axioms:
    Natural numbers set of N:
        Basis: 0 part of N
        Rules: for (n : B) succ(n) part of N
        Concl: for any subset P in N, if 0 part of P, then P is equal to N

        ! succ must be unique. succ can't return an already returned value. 0 can't be succ
